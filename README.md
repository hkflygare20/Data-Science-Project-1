# Data-Science-Project-1
Blog Post
I chose to analyze the affect of media bias on political polls.  This project showed that it had no effect, so I tried to draw useful conclusions.  I mostly used the pandas library for this dataset, but all libraries used are included in the header of the code.
The files in the repository include:
1. the dataset: Favorability-Unfavorability Candidate Data from Kaggle
2. the code: how I used data science to do a statistical analysis on the data
3. images of the graphs generated
